> Our team consists of Matvey Lubaev, Rayyan Kahn, Tara Meazell, and Benito Juarez.

> We are creating a web-based application that can pull desired information from NASA’s API library and display it to users.

> We are creating the app for students who are trying to learn more about NASA’s research. Attempting to allow ease of access by providing an app that can pull info from keywords.

> We hope to allow easy access to desired data from NASA’s APIs. The program will have a hardcoded key to access the API so users will not have to create their own to pull information

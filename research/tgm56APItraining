name of training: Research how to use APIs in Javascript

I am doing this training because I have not ever taken a class using Javascript and have no experience with web developement, but these are the tools we will be using for our project.

I expect to learn some basics of Javascript as well as understand what an API is, and learn how to call it with XMLhttps request

I expect to utilize this training for converting the information from the API to a readable format on our page. I will be able to convert .json data to text or images.

This research will prepare me for the task "Display pictures from APIs" which is assigned to me.

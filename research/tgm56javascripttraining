Title or name of research/training:
Basic javascript

Why you are doing it:
Because I have little experience with Javascript and I need to review how to display text in the JSX portion of my APOD page.

What you expect to learn/do.   Be specific by identifying what code/modules will be affected by the research/training:
I will learn how to utilize different attributes when receiving data from my APIs to display them on the page cprrectly.
I will also research image/video displays to help me look forward on how to display videos from the APOD api

What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  Be specific.  For example, "Writing the UI" is not sufficient.   "Writing the Login class" is.
I will write code that displays the title of today's apod image and also displays a paragraph description of the image.

What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training.
This will fulfill my task to create a UI display for the text information from the APOD api

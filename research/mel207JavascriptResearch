Name of training: Research the basic syntax and structure of javascript, html, and css

The reason I am doing this training is because I have never done web development before. While studying the structure of javascipt,
I realized I also had to learn html and css structure becuase they are intertwined.

I used this video to gain an introduction the html javascipt and css https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78
I used this youtube video to learn on basic structure https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GTMOmRrqkU

This research will prepare me for the task "create a class which uses an API key to access NASA API"
